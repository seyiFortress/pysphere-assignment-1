# pysphere-assignment-1🧪 PySphere Assignment – Git & Python Practice: Ohm's Law - Assignment 1
📅 Due Date: 12th August 2025

📌 Objective:
This assignment is designed to help you practice using:
Git and GitHub (version control & cloud collaboration)


Python basics (variables, input/output, calculations)


Uploading your work to a GitHub repository



💡 Task:
You're going to write a simple Python program that calculates Voltage (V) using Ohm’s Law:
Ohm's Law Formula:
 🔹 V = I * R
 Where:
V is Voltage (in volts)


I is Current (in amperes)


R is Resistance (in ohms)



🧠 What You Need to Do:
1. Create a GitHub Account (if you don’t have one)
👉 Go to https://github.com/ and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a New Repository
Name it something like: pysphere-assignment-1


Make it public 


Add a README file


3. Clone the Repository to Your Computer
Open your terminal or Git Bash and run:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pysphere-assignment-1.git

4. Write Your Python Script
Inside the cloned folder, create a Python file (e.g., ohms_law.py) with code that:
Asks the user to input values for current (I) and resistance (R)


Calculates and prints the voltage (V) using V = I * R


Example behavior:
Enter the current (in A): 3
Enter the resistance (in ohms): 10
The voltage is: 30 volts

5. Push Your Code to GitHub
In your terminal:
git add .
git commit -m "Added solution for Ohm's Law assignment"
git push

Your code should now be visible on your GitHub repo online.

✅ Submission Checklist
Before you consider the assignment done, confirm the following:
GitHub repo is created and public


Python file (ohms_law.py) is pushed to the repo


Your script calculates voltage correctly


Your name or username is included in the README or as a comment in the code



📬 How to Submit:
Send your GitHub repository link to the  form (a Google Form). Make sure the link is accessible. Use this link to submit:
